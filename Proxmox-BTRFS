Installing proxmox with btrfs and subvolumes, snapper automated snapshots, and auto-grub...

HW: 2 SSDs (sda, sdb) and 2 HDDs (sdc and sdd)
Notes:
- Will be setting-up proxmox on SDDs in RAID1 configuration.
- HDDs will be set-up later after system is up and running and are NOT required for installation.
- If you have only single SSD or HDD, go along this guide, only choose RAID0 during setup. Later I'll show you how to change it to single...

1) Start Proxmox installer and proceed the usual way until partitioning.
2) For partition, choose BTRFS file system, RAID 1 configuration.
3) Deselect all disks, and then for Disk 1 choose sda, and for Disk 2 choose sdb.
4) On advanced options you may choose a compression if you wish. I went with zstd.
5) Continue installation standard way and reboot.

6) After reboot, do not go to browser as instructed. Stay in console, or you can ssh in as root with password you specified during installation.
